# Fashion Theory: Building an Equitable Fashion Future

## Problem Statement Overview

In today's globalized fashion industry, there's a significant disconnect between artisans preserving traditional craftsmanship and consumers seeking sustainable, culturally-rich products. The existing fashion ecosystem often prioritizes mass production and short-term profits, leading to:

1. **Loss of Cultural Heritage**: Traditional artisans and craftspeople struggle to compete in global markets, resulting in the gradual disappearance of unique cultural techniques and designs.

2. **Economic Inequality**: Skilled artisans often lack direct access to markets, forcing them to sell through intermediaries at unfair prices.

3. **Lack of Transparency**: Consumers can't easily verify the sustainability practices, cultural significance, or origin of their clothing purchases.

4. **Unsustainable Consumption**: Without proper organization and planning tools, consumers often make redundant purchases and contribute to fashion waste.
